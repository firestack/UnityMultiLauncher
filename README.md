# Unity Multi Launcher
It's currently in development and not finished, I don't know how much time I
can put into it at the moment.

If you do use my code or this program please let me know!
I'd like to know how I can improve it or hear about any
bugs people may encounter.

## Current restrictions
 - Windows Only
	 - Windows Registry Dependency (Unity Project Lookup)
	 - WPF GUI Dependency
 - Can't find all instances of unity autonomously
 	- In Windows when you install multiple versions of unity
	  it only puts the latest one into your Registry and
	  program files
